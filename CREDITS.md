Ramnatthan Alagappan, Aishwarya Ganesan, and Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai were involved in design of PACE. PACE is inspired from ALICE that finds single-machine crash vulnerabilities (initially designed and implemented by Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai). Many parts of the code were directly forked off from ALICE and modified. Aishwarya Ganesan tested the tool extensively by applying it to multiple systems. Yuvraj Patel also tested the tool by applying it to elasticsearch.

Ramnatthan Alagappan(ra@cs.wisc.edu) is the primary author of the tool, and is the best contact for bug reports, feature requests, or other clarifications. The PACE tool is a by-product of a Crash Vulnerabilities research project (http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/ram-osdi16.html) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and due credit must be given to everyone who
was involved in or contributed to the project. Please <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/pace-osdi16.bib">cite this paper</a>, if you use this work/tool.  

The alice-strace tracing tool is a direct fork off from ALICE project. alice-strace framework is a slight customization of the strace tool (http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/), along with some code adapted from strace-plus (https://code.google.com/p/strace-plus/). Credits must be given to the authors and contributors of strace and strace-plus.
